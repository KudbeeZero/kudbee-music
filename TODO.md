# 🧠 HERMES — TODO

The living backlog. **Nothing gets stale, nothing gets mixed, nothing gets missed.**
The README [Roadmap](README.md#-roadmap) is the highlight reel; this is the working
list. Raw ideas land first in [`IDEAS.md`](IDEAS.md) (the capture net — nothing the
artist says gets lost), then graduate here once designed. Check items off as they ship.

> Convention: `[x]` done · `[~]` in progress · `[ ]` not started. Keep the most
> recently shipped items at the top of **Shipped** so the history reads newest-first.

## 🚧 In progress
_Nothing actively in flight — pick the next item from **Up next**._

## 🧠 Brain buildout queue (autonomous /loop — research-informed)
1. [x] **Local lexicon** (vocabulary cortex) — token-free word store. _(shipped)_
2. [x] **Rhyme + meter engine** — `lib/hermes/rhyme.ts`: end-rhyme/scheme/density +
   lexicon rhyme families; the combinator now writes **rhymed couplets**, and hook
   scoring is honest (brevity + theme reference + internal rhyme, not length+RNG). _(shipped)_
3. [x] **Emotion → diction** — the limbic valence now picks the rhyme words + adjective
   pool (dark vs bright), so word choice leans with the mood. _(shipped)_
4. [x] **Default-Mode Network** — `lib/hermes/defaultMode.ts`: surfaces divergent
   angles on the brief (creativity-at-rest); the 10th brain region, coupled by nerves to
   generative + decision + analytical; feeds a divergent option into the concept step. _(shipped)_
5. [x] **Reward circuit** — `lib/hermes/reward.ts`: crave-ability score (returns +
   mutation + brevity + singability); the 11th brain region, surfaced by the A&R Judge. _(shipped)_
6. [ ] **Procedural memory** — the artist's recurring craft moves become reusable.
7. [ ] **"Becoming you" self-portrait** — surface how much of a song is the learned voice.

## 🎯 Up next (ordered) — the depth-pass plan (see `/root/.claude/plans/…`)
0. [ ] **Real-audio flagship video** — render a properly **vocal-synced** Cold Hard
   Gold video from the *actual* Suno master (needs the real lyrics, not the generated
   demo lyrics, so sync is honest). Completes Phase 1's end-to-end proof.
1. [ ] **Phase 2 — make the local engine real ($0):** rhyme-aware combinator +
   escalating hooks (`text.ts`, `mockLyricsProvider.ts`); honest, non-gameable
   scoring — semantic hook strength, hook-mutation replay value, arc via transition
   tokens (`scoring.ts`, `pipeline.ts`); smarter recommendations (`recommend.ts`).
2. [ ] **Phase 3 — real AI behind the adapters (opt-in, behind keys):**
   `claudeLyricsProvider` (default stays mock → $0), optional Suno API bridge,
   rhyme/BPM validation loop.
3. [ ] **Phase 4 — durability + unify the studios:** stop localStorage data loss,
   in-app video preview, video studio reachable from the web app; video-engine
   generality (auto section detection, shotlist DSL, `--bpm`, `--auto-refine`).
- [ ] **Per-track Suno structure hints** — `[Intro]`/`[Bridge]` pacing, stems, BPM/key
   tags in the Suno export (folds into Phase 2/3).
- [ ] **Docs site on GitHub Pages** — Astro Starlight (folds into Phase 4).

## 💡 Backlog (unordered ideas)
- [ ] **Live preview = the review path** — deploy to **Vercel** (free, instant
      `*.vercel.app` URL) so the founder can review each change in a browser; point
      **wifidj.xyz** at it later as the branded home. No domain needed to start.
- [ ] **16:9 scene builder wired to the video studio** straight from a Hit Factory package
      (today `hermes from-song` scaffolds the project; this would auto-pick shots).
- [ ] **Artist/project vault** server-side (today the vault is localStorage only).
- [ ] **Release calendar** + per-track release-readiness tracking.
- [ ] **More scene packs** (community-extensible — the easiest contribution).
- [ ] **More expansion packs** (Suno style presets — the song-side equivalent).
- [ ] **Team / agent marketplace** — share agent rosters and packs.
- [ ] **Stripe credits** for any future hosted/paid lane (kept optional).
- [ ] **Social-preview + demo reel refresh** when the next flagship video lands.

## 🧭 North star — the WIFI DJ "Lyrical Recombinator Framework"
This repo is the **AI-engine pillar** of [WIFI DJ](https://wifidj.xyz). Our build maps
onto the framework's three parts (we stay original-only — influences are *felt, never
copied*; no living-artist mimicry):
1. **Deconstruct the influences** — thematic cartography, lexical fingerprinting,
   architectural blueprinting → an **Influence Studio** (describe an influence → craft
   parameters; reuse `learn.ts` + originality fingerprints). *Guardrail: structure &
   feel, never an artist's actual words.*
2. **The generation engine** — probabilistic model + **syllabic constraint layer** +
   **rhyme architect** → Phase 2 (rhyme/meter in `text.ts`/`mockLyricsProvider.ts`) +
   Phase 3 (real LLM behind the adapter).
3. **The ghost in the machine** — the ~20% novelty + community **prompting tags** →
   `originality.ts` + seed/variety + steering hooks.
The **Writers-Room** (`process.ts`) is the human-craft layer on top; the **Crossroads
Board** governance / Solana / token / NFT layer integrates with this engine via API
later (kept out of this repo's core so it stays free + local).

## ✅ Shipped (newest first)
- [x] **Rhyme + meter engine** — `lib/hermes/rhyme.ts` (end-rhyme, scheme, density,
      lexicon rhyme families). The combinator writes **rhymed couplets** now (verses
      actually rhyme), and hook scoring is **honest** — brevity + theme reference +
      internal rhyme, not length + RNG. Closes the "lyrics don't rhyme / gameable
      score" weakness. _(this PR)_
- [x] **Local lexicon (vocabulary cortex)** — `brain/lexicon/core.json` + `lib/hermes/lexicon.ts`:
      a token-free, version-controlled word store (part-of-speech, affect/valence,
      imagery tag) with heuristic **syllable counting** and **rhyme matching**
      (`rhymesWith`, `doesRhyme`), plus affect/imagery queries. The offline backbone for
      the rhyme engine + emotion-colored diction. Grow it by adding words to the JSON. _(this PR)_
- [x] **Limbic (emotion) layer** — `lib/hermes/emotion.ts`: reads mood into an affect
      model (valence/intensity/primary feeling), proposes the emotional **contrast** for
      depth, and maps sections onto an emotional **arc**. Feeds the Writers-Room
      (concept + arc) and enriches the Emotion Scanner. Its own **Limbic brain region**
      (9/9) now lights up. Emotion is now *shaped*, not just scored. _(this PR)_
- [x] **Deploy path + `wifidj.xyz` wiring** — `docs/deploy.md`: the app is fully static
      (all routes prerendered), so `STATIC_EXPORT=1 next build` → `out/` hosts on
      **Cloudflare Pages** with one env var (or Vercel, already configured). Env-gated
      static export in `next.config.mjs`; `out/` fully gitignored. _(this PR)_
- [x] **`/resume` continuity skill** — `.claude/skills/resume/SKILL.md`: a new chat runs
      `/resume` to pick up exactly where the last left off — reads TODO/IDEAS/docs, checks
      git + open PRs (nothing stale/crossed), states the workflow rules, proposes the next
      step. _(this PR)_
- [x] **Language & Culture area** — `lib/hermes/language.ts`: maps the artist's OWN
      described background (where you're from / what shaped you) + voice into craft
      levers (register, diction, imagery from their own words, vernacular), with
      struggle-as-depth (truth-first). Feeds the Writers-Room truth/draft steps and a
      new Lyric Lab brief field. The dim brain region now **lights up** (wired to the
      lyric-chemist) — the whole brain is active. Original-only, never a group profile. _(this PR)_
- [x] **Nervous system + memory tiers** — the brain's signalling + memory layer:
      `lib/hermes/brainMap.ts` (regions + nerves, single source of truth),
      `lib/hermes/nervousSystem.ts` (a signal bus), `lib/hermes/workingMemory.ts`
      (decaying short-term memory that **consolidates** into long-term on save). The
      Brain Scan draws the nerves and **pulses them live** as signals travel; Short-term
      and Long-term are now distinct regions. _(this PR)_
- [x] **Brain Scan (v1)** — `components/hermes/BrainScan.tsx`: an anatomical brain whose
      functional regions light up as the agents fire (cyan=left/analytical,
      magenta=right/generative, amber=center). **Each region is a knowledge file** you
      can tap (the Obsidian-style vault, made visual). Language & Culture region pending. _(this PR)_
- [x] **Lyric Lab** — the Writers-Room made visible (`components/hermes/LyricLab.tsx`):
      pick a craft persona, walk the 9 steps with options *and reasons*, commit choices;
      the committed **hook becomes the song's real hook** (pipeline `forcedHook`), and
      every choice **trains the voice** (`recordTaste`). _(this PR)_
- [x] **Persona engine — anonymized craft-DNA** (framework Part 1, original-only) —
      `brain/personas.json` + `lib/hermes/personas.ts`: 6 lyrical-mind archetypes
      (subjects, rhyme density, cadence, structure, register, novelty); `matchPersona`
      / `suggestPersona` map a *described feel* (never a name) to the closest archetype;
      `personaOverlay` steers each Writers-Room step. No artist names, no lyrics. _(this PR)_
- [x] **Writers-Room engine + belief system** — `lib/hermes/process.ts` (the 9-step
      craft assistant: concept→truth→perspective→hook→rhyme→draft→revise→arc, options
      *with reasons*, voice-signal capture) + `brain/beliefs.json` constitution
      (`lib/hermes/beliefs.ts`). The proprietary edge: assistant, not autopilot. _(this PR)_
- [x] **Phase 1 — Proof & loop polish** — flagship **Cold Hard Gold** example
      (`examples/cold-hard-gold/`, minted by the real pipeline, 99/100) seeded into
      the app's empty state via a one-click "see a finished example" button; the
      song→video **Suno handoff** (`from-song` emits a ready-to-paste Suno link +
      Style + Lyrics, `build` gives clear guidance when `track.mp3` is missing);
      honest score labels. _(this PR)_
- [x] **Public testing URL** — `vercel.json` (Vercel-ready) + `docs/testing.md`
      (Vercel / Codespaces / local tunnel) + `scripts/expose.sh`. _(PR #10)_
- [x] **Song → video bridge** — `hermes from-song` turns a Hit Factory song package
      into a renderable video project; both studios fused. _(PR #9)_
- [x] **Learn from edits** — rewriting lyrics teaches the brain a taste model
      (added vs cut words); a repeatedly-cut word becomes a one-tap exclusion. _(PR #8)_
- [x] **Memory + learning brain + albums** — `brain/memory.json` exclusion list,
      artist profile, recommendations, album assembly + one-block Suno export,
      production expansion packs (`drill-dark`, `soul-sample`, `trap-ballad`). _(PR #7)_
- [x] **Hit Factory V1** — 10-agent song-creation studio (Next.js + React), banger
      score (/100), local uniqueness checker, vault, vendor-neutral adapters,
      no API key. _(PR #6)_
- [x] **Two-hemisphere brain** — `--brain right|left|balanced` dominance dial,
      `hermes-qa` eval gate (CI-gated), `brain/hemispheres.md` + `brain/brain.json`. _(PR #5)_
- [x] **Audio mastering** — `hermes master` two-pass EBU R128 to −14 LUFS / −1 dBTP. _(PR #5)_
- [x] **Scene packs** — `neo-noir`, `retrowave`, `vhs-lofi`, `lyric-minimal`;
      project-targeted builds (`hermes build <dir>`); 9:16/1:1/4:5 aspect ratios. _(PRs #1, #5)_
- [x] **Code-only, vocal-synced 1080p music videos** — the flagship: Whisper
      force-aligned lyrics, headless Chromium → ffmpeg, $0 of paid software. _(PR #1)_

## 🔁 Working agreement (so nothing gets left behind)
- One open PR at a time where possible; **once CI is green on a PR, mark it ready and
  merge it** — don't park drafts.
- A merged branch is finished — **follow-up work goes on a fresh branch / new PR**,
  never stacked on already-merged history.
- When something ships, move it from **Up next/Backlog** to **Shipped** in the same PR,
  and update the README Roadmap if it's highlight-worthy. Keep this file and the README
  in sync.
