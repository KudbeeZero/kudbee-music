# 🧠 HERMES — TODO

The living backlog. **Nothing gets stale, nothing gets mixed, nothing gets missed.**
The README [Roadmap](README.md#-roadmap) is the highlight reel; this is the working
list. Check items off here as they ship, and add new ideas under **Backlog**.

> Convention: `[x]` done · `[~]` in progress · `[ ]` not started. Keep the most
> recently shipped items at the top of **Shipped** so the history reads newest-first.

## 🚧 In progress
_Nothing actively in flight — pick the next item from **Up next**._

## 🎯 Up next (ordered)
1. [ ] **Per-track Suno structure hints** — emit `[Intro]`/`[Verse]`/`[Bridge]`/`[Outro]`
   pacing, stem suggestions, and BPM/key tags into the Suno export block.
2. [ ] **Auto song-structure detection** in the video studio — segment sections from
   beats + energy novelty + whisper, instead of hand-authored `SECTIONS`.
3. [ ] **Docs site on GitHub Pages** — Astro Starlight: quickstart, concepts, CLI ref,
   build-a-pack, hit-factory guide; deploy via Actions.
4. [ ] **A real AI/music provider** behind the adapters (lyrics + audio) — drop a vendor
   in behind `LyricsProvider`/`AudioProvider` without touching the agents.

## 💡 Backlog (unordered ideas)
- [ ] **16:9 scene builder wired to the video studio** straight from a Hit Factory package
      (today `hermes from-song` scaffolds the project; this would auto-pick shots).
- [ ] **Artist/project vault** server-side (today the vault is localStorage only).
- [ ] **Release calendar** + per-track release-readiness tracking.
- [ ] **More scene packs** (community-extensible — the easiest contribution).
- [ ] **More expansion packs** (Suno style presets — the song-side equivalent).
- [ ] **Team / agent marketplace** — share agent rosters and packs.
- [ ] **Stripe credits** for any future hosted/paid lane (kept optional).
- [ ] **Social-preview + demo reel refresh** when the next flagship video lands.

## ✅ Shipped (newest first)
- [x] **Public testing URL** — `vercel.json` (Vercel-ready) + `docs/testing.md`
      (Vercel / Codespaces / local tunnel) + `scripts/expose.sh`. _(PR #10)_
- [x] **Song → video bridge** — `hermes from-song` turns a Hit Factory song package
      into a renderable video project; both studios fused. _(PR #9)_
- [x] **Learn from edits** — rewriting lyrics teaches the brain a taste model
      (added vs cut words); a repeatedly-cut word becomes a one-tap exclusion. _(PR #8)_
- [x] **Memory + learning brain + albums** — `brain/memory.json` exclusion list,
      artist profile, recommendations, album assembly + one-block Suno export,
      production expansion packs (`drill-dark`, `soul-sample`, `trap-ballad`). _(PR #7)_
- [x] **Hit Factory V1** — 10-agent song-creation studio (Next.js + React), banger
      score (/100), local uniqueness checker, vault, vendor-neutral adapters,
      no API key. _(PR #6)_
- [x] **Two-hemisphere brain** — `--brain right|left|balanced` dominance dial,
      `hermes-qa` eval gate (CI-gated), `brain/hemispheres.md` + `brain/brain.json`. _(PR #5)_
- [x] **Audio mastering** — `hermes master` two-pass EBU R128 to −14 LUFS / −1 dBTP. _(PR #5)_
- [x] **Scene packs** — `neo-noir`, `retrowave`, `vhs-lofi`, `lyric-minimal`;
      project-targeted builds (`hermes build <dir>`); 9:16/1:1/4:5 aspect ratios. _(PRs #1, #5)_
- [x] **Code-only, vocal-synced 1080p music videos** — the flagship: Whisper
      force-aligned lyrics, headless Chromium → ffmpeg, $0 of paid software. _(PR #1)_

## 🔁 Working agreement (so nothing gets left behind)
- One open PR at a time where possible; **once CI is green on a PR, mark it ready and
  merge it** — don't park drafts.
- A merged branch is finished — **follow-up work goes on a fresh branch / new PR**,
  never stacked on already-merged history.
- When something ships, move it from **Up next/Backlog** to **Shipped** in the same PR,
  and update the README Roadmap if it's highlight-worthy. Keep this file and the README
  in sync.
