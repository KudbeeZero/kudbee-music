# 🧠 HERMES — TODO

The living backlog. **Nothing gets stale, nothing gets mixed, nothing gets missed.**
The README [Roadmap](README.md#-roadmap) is the highlight reel; this is the working
list. Raw ideas land first in [`IDEAS.md`](IDEAS.md) (the capture net — nothing the
artist says gets lost), then graduate here once designed. Check items off as they ship.

> Convention: `[x]` done · `[~]` in progress · `[ ]` not started. Keep the most
> recently shipped items at the top of **Shipped** so the history reads newest-first.

## 🚧 In progress
_Nothing actively in flight — pick the next item from **Up next**._

## 🎯 Up next (ordered) — the depth-pass plan (see `/root/.claude/plans/…`)
0. [ ] **Real-audio flagship video** — render a properly **vocal-synced** Cold Hard
   Gold video from the *actual* Suno master (needs the real lyrics, not the generated
   demo lyrics, so sync is honest). Completes Phase 1's end-to-end proof.
1. [ ] **Phase 2 — make the local engine real ($0):** rhyme-aware combinator +
   escalating hooks (`text.ts`, `mockLyricsProvider.ts`); honest, non-gameable
   scoring — semantic hook strength, hook-mutation replay value, arc via transition
   tokens (`scoring.ts`, `pipeline.ts`); smarter recommendations (`recommend.ts`).
2. [ ] **Phase 3 — real AI behind the adapters (opt-in, behind keys):**
   `claudeLyricsProvider` (default stays mock → $0), optional Suno API bridge,
   rhyme/BPM validation loop.
3. [ ] **Phase 4 — durability + unify the studios:** stop localStorage data loss,
   in-app video preview, video studio reachable from the web app; video-engine
   generality (auto section detection, shotlist DSL, `--bpm`, `--auto-refine`).
- [ ] **Per-track Suno structure hints** — `[Intro]`/`[Bridge]` pacing, stems, BPM/key
   tags in the Suno export (folds into Phase 2/3).
- [ ] **Docs site on GitHub Pages** — Astro Starlight (folds into Phase 4).

## 💡 Backlog (unordered ideas)
- [ ] **16:9 scene builder wired to the video studio** straight from a Hit Factory package
      (today `hermes from-song` scaffolds the project; this would auto-pick shots).
- [ ] **Artist/project vault** server-side (today the vault is localStorage only).
- [ ] **Release calendar** + per-track release-readiness tracking.
- [ ] **More scene packs** (community-extensible — the easiest contribution).
- [ ] **More expansion packs** (Suno style presets — the song-side equivalent).
- [ ] **Team / agent marketplace** — share agent rosters and packs.
- [ ] **Stripe credits** for any future hosted/paid lane (kept optional).
- [ ] **Social-preview + demo reel refresh** when the next flagship video lands.

## 🧭 North star — the WIFI DJ "Lyrical Recombinator Framework"
This repo is the **AI-engine pillar** of [WIFI DJ](https://wifidj.xyz). Our build maps
onto the framework's three parts (we stay original-only — influences are *felt, never
copied*; no living-artist mimicry):
1. **Deconstruct the influences** — thematic cartography, lexical fingerprinting,
   architectural blueprinting → an **Influence Studio** (describe an influence → craft
   parameters; reuse `learn.ts` + originality fingerprints). *Guardrail: structure &
   feel, never an artist's actual words.*
2. **The generation engine** — probabilistic model + **syllabic constraint layer** +
   **rhyme architect** → Phase 2 (rhyme/meter in `text.ts`/`mockLyricsProvider.ts`) +
   Phase 3 (real LLM behind the adapter).
3. **The ghost in the machine** — the ~20% novelty + community **prompting tags** →
   `originality.ts` + seed/variety + steering hooks.
The **Writers-Room** (`process.ts`) is the human-craft layer on top; the **Crossroads
Board** governance / Solana / token / NFT layer integrates with this engine via API
later (kept out of this repo's core so it stays free + local).

## ✅ Shipped (newest first)
- [x] **Persona engine — anonymized craft-DNA** (framework Part 1, original-only) —
      `brain/personas.json` + `lib/hermes/personas.ts`: 6 lyrical-mind archetypes
      (subjects, rhyme density, cadence, structure, register, novelty); `matchPersona`
      / `suggestPersona` map a *described feel* (never a name) to the closest archetype;
      `personaOverlay` steers each Writers-Room step. No artist names, no lyrics. _(this PR)_
- [x] **Writers-Room engine + belief system** — `lib/hermes/process.ts` (the 9-step
      craft assistant: concept→truth→perspective→hook→rhyme→draft→revise→arc, options
      *with reasons*, voice-signal capture) + `brain/beliefs.json` constitution
      (`lib/hermes/beliefs.ts`). The proprietary edge: assistant, not autopilot. _(this PR)_
- [x] **Phase 1 — Proof & loop polish** — flagship **Cold Hard Gold** example
      (`examples/cold-hard-gold/`, minted by the real pipeline, 99/100) seeded into
      the app's empty state via a one-click "see a finished example" button; the
      song→video **Suno handoff** (`from-song` emits a ready-to-paste Suno link +
      Style + Lyrics, `build` gives clear guidance when `track.mp3` is missing);
      honest score labels. _(this PR)_
- [x] **Public testing URL** — `vercel.json` (Vercel-ready) + `docs/testing.md`
      (Vercel / Codespaces / local tunnel) + `scripts/expose.sh`. _(PR #10)_
- [x] **Song → video bridge** — `hermes from-song` turns a Hit Factory song package
      into a renderable video project; both studios fused. _(PR #9)_
- [x] **Learn from edits** — rewriting lyrics teaches the brain a taste model
      (added vs cut words); a repeatedly-cut word becomes a one-tap exclusion. _(PR #8)_
- [x] **Memory + learning brain + albums** — `brain/memory.json` exclusion list,
      artist profile, recommendations, album assembly + one-block Suno export,
      production expansion packs (`drill-dark`, `soul-sample`, `trap-ballad`). _(PR #7)_
- [x] **Hit Factory V1** — 10-agent song-creation studio (Next.js + React), banger
      score (/100), local uniqueness checker, vault, vendor-neutral adapters,
      no API key. _(PR #6)_
- [x] **Two-hemisphere brain** — `--brain right|left|balanced` dominance dial,
      `hermes-qa` eval gate (CI-gated), `brain/hemispheres.md` + `brain/brain.json`. _(PR #5)_
- [x] **Audio mastering** — `hermes master` two-pass EBU R128 to −14 LUFS / −1 dBTP. _(PR #5)_
- [x] **Scene packs** — `neo-noir`, `retrowave`, `vhs-lofi`, `lyric-minimal`;
      project-targeted builds (`hermes build <dir>`); 9:16/1:1/4:5 aspect ratios. _(PRs #1, #5)_
- [x] **Code-only, vocal-synced 1080p music videos** — the flagship: Whisper
      force-aligned lyrics, headless Chromium → ffmpeg, $0 of paid software. _(PR #1)_

## 🔁 Working agreement (so nothing gets left behind)
- One open PR at a time where possible; **once CI is green on a PR, mark it ready and
  merge it** — don't park drafts.
- A merged branch is finished — **follow-up work goes on a fresh branch / new PR**,
  never stacked on already-merged history.
- When something ships, move it from **Up next/Backlog** to **Shipped** in the same PR,
  and update the README Roadmap if it's highlight-worthy. Keep this file and the README
  in sync.
